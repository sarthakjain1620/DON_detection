# Project Overview
This project includes a comprehensive notebook containing all the necessary input, output, and the trained model. The notebook provides a step-by-step workflow for data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Contents
- **Dataset Processing**: Data is loaded, cleaned, and preprocessed.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization and statistical summaries to understand data distribution.
- **Feature Selection**: Important features are selected using SHAP values and other techniques.
- **Model Training**: A machine learning model is trained using selected features.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is assessed using various metrics.
- **Predictions**: The model is used to make predictions on test data.

## Instructions
1. Open the notebook mentioned above.
2. Follow the workflow to understand data processing and model building.
3. All required input files and outputs, including the trained model, are available within the notebook.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- SHAP
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- PyTorch (if deep learning is used)

## Notes
- Ensure that all dependencies are installed before running the notebook.
- If any modifications are needed, refer to the code cells in the notebook and adjust accordingly.
